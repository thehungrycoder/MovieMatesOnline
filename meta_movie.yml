And what price did he end up paying for his total commitment?

After saving hundreds - maybe even thousands - he is challenged once more, this time to save his newfound love from the death penalty issued by the regime. Another impossible task and a desperate chase against time. Based on a true story about a man, that did, what all of us only dreams of."

  overview: "Roughly chronological, from 3/96 to 11/96, with a coda in spring of 1997: inside compounds of Aum Shinrikyo, a Buddhist sect led by Shoko Asahara. (Members confessed to a murderous sarin attack in the Tokyo subway in 1995.) We see what they eat, where they sleep, and how they respond to media scrutiny, on-going trials, the shrinking of their fortunes, and the criticism of society. Central focus is on Hiroshi Araki, deputy spokesperson, 28, slight, mild, diffident. He and others speak of erasing desire - for food, for love, for sex, for family. The filmmaker becomes a participant when police harass and arrest a sect member. What is it to be different in a conformist society?\n\n"

  overview: "Mark Boerebach lives in a black and white world but he dreams in color. A nearly blind recluse with Aspergers Syndrome, can he break out of his constrictive routine and show his amazing music chart recall on a live TV quiz show? Along the way we have some incredible insights into Mark&#x27;s sad and remarkable life. Socially ostracized his whole life he has a encyclopedic knowledge of the Australian music charts. Though plagued by anxieties he is an endearing figure as he reveals his bizarre relationship to a now defunct plastic bottle and his double life as an Astronaut/ Media Baron in a place called Earth 2. This film received an unprecedented response when it aired on Australian TV and has now been re-edited as a stand-alone international program.\n\n"
